    <h1>Enhancing learning opportunities</h1>

    <p>The internet enhances flexibility in learning, making it more attractive and interactive. It creates a student-centered private environment which enables learners to feel more free, responsible, and drives their active participation. Meanwhile, the 24/7 access to the internet offers a flexible way of learning.</p>       
    <p>Any learner has an opportunity to select the time and place to learn. The internet also provides access to a wide range of multiple, interactive resources and learning experiences. This can be likened to a library with a constantly updated collection of materials relevant to the curriculum.</p>
    <p>And the use of email correspondence, social media platforms to communicate, transfer learning materials, assignment instructions, conduct discussions and support from teachers who may provide guidance and support through various communication channels such as telephone, video conferencing, emails and weblinks.</p>
    
    <h2>Facilitating communication and collaboration</h2>   

    <p>Access to digital technology and The Internet serves to “narrow” information gaps. Literally, it provides a means to online information that was difficult or impossible to access without data technology or the Internet, for example, in a remote area, a person’s home or another hard-to-reach location, such as a library or community center after it’s been “closed” for the day.</p> 
    <p>Internet devices can transfer big and small data files allowing instant information sharing. The use of these technologies can both supplement and advance learning in traditional and progressive instructional settings.</p>
    <p>In these modern times especially, it is not possible to overemphasize the influence it has wielded on nearly every aspect of our daily lives, from access to information, to communication, commerce, entertainment, international cooperation, and so on. To undersign The Internet’s transformative power even in this short space, however, misses that the capability of the technology is deeply tethered with the environments and the resources that support it. No group, society, nation, or state can effectively leverage The Internet without basic and appropriate digital technology, tangibly, hardware and requisite software genre, or the infrastructure that enables telecommunication.</p>
