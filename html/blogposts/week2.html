    <h1>Code Reviews and Feedback:</h1>

    <p>As I gained more experience, I started seeking feedback on my code from peers and the wider community. Participating in code reviews taught me to write cleaner, more maintainable code and to consider edge cases and potential improvements that I might have overlooked. Constructive criticism helped me grow as a developer and encouraged me to adopt best practices and coding standards.</p>
    <p>I also began to understand that complex code doesn't necessarily indicate that I know what I am doing as a web developer, if anything it indicates that I am trying to hide behind complexity without truly understanding the functions of the code that I am implementing.</p>   
    <p>To resolve this I restructured my initial webpage to be more user friendly and straightforward affording for better accessibility and navigation.</p>

    <h2>Version Control Mishaps:</h2>   

    <p>Despite my initial understanding of version control, there were times when I made mistakes that affected my project's history. These included accidentally pushing scripts and overwriting important files with incorrect changes.</p>
    <p>Through these mistakes, I learned the importance of double-checking before committing and pushing changes, as well as utilizing features like .gitignore to prevent sensitive information from being tracked.</p>
