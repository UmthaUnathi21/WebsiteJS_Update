    <h1>Impact of JavaScript on Algorithmic Injustices</h1>

    <p>A second example brings into play the recent popularity and ease of use in AJAX-based web applications. By providing seamless stored data updates to the end user and eliminating the need for page refresh, AJAX aids in creating a very intuitive and dynamic web experience.But when this is paired with database and/or search algorithms with AI characteristics, changes to user-derived data may have unexpected and undesired effects on the said user. </p>
                
    <p>With the relational dynamic between developer and end user, what can be innocuous and routine data collection from a user may be an act carried out under the pretense of power and coercion. Taking data from form entries as an example, a user may only intend to submit the necessary information to successfully pass the input validation constraints. This is data that the user would perceive as necessary and relevant to the task at hand. </p>
    <p>However, in some cases, this data may be intercepted and further data mining scripts may extract additional information under the assumption that more is better or that the data will be useful for another task. This can lead to the user feeling violated and suspicious as to why certain data was added to his/her profile or why they later received targeted advertisements for specific products. </p>
        
    <p>    JavaScript stands as the most utilized and widely known programming language used in crafting the behavior of websites. Through intensive client-server interaction, JavaScript opens up several channels for information to be collected from the end user. This may engage simple form fields, passing user-derived data back to the server, or managing cookies and other session-based data.</p>
    <p>Although the channels opened by JavaScript are beneficial in creating a responsive and intuitive website, it is these very same channels that we must critically reflect upon due to their potential harmful side effects in relation to algorithmic injustices.     
</p>

    <h2>Strategies for Streamlining Interaction Design</h2>   

    <p> It is important to have some metric to gauge whether interaction design decisions are right or not. Much of the reason why algorithm biases still exist today is simply that it is difficult to tell whether one design decision is better than another, and we would like to avoid the same fate.</p> 
        
    <p>    Offering a set of best practices guidelines targeted specifically at web developers in creating clearer and simpler UIs is another approach. These might include many of the do's and don'ts mentioned in the previous sections, but tailored specifically to decisions that web developers will be making.</p>
        
    <p>    Another approach might be to try to offer alternative interaction designs in areas where they might be too difficult to implement. Oftentimes, the reason a system has a bad interaction design is that the problem is inherently too difficult to design for. An AI subsystem might have a particularly bad user interface because the task of making a user interface for that subsystem is in itself a complex AI problem.</p>
    
    <p>    In this case, it might be possible to attack the problem from both ends, the AI and the interface. If the AI problem is solved so that little thinking is necessary on the part of the user, it is possible that a simple interface will suffice. If this is not the case, it is still possible to offer the alternative design and save the simple design for a future different version of the system, hopefully without confusing the two.</p> 
        
    <p>      However, this might be a difficult suggestion to make, as sometimes the reason a website is confusing and difficult to navigate is simply design oversight and not because it was a deliberate design choice. Coming from the developers, this suggestion will be more readily accepted if tools can be provided that make it easier to adhere to the suggestion.</p>
           An example of such a tool might be a cognitive walkthrough analyzer that takes a series of AJAX interactions and predicts the resulting possible states of the system and compares it to some desired global state to point out where things could go wrong. </p>
