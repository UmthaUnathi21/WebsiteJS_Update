    <h1>Background of The World-Wide Web</h1>

    <p>The World-Wide Web (W-3, or simply web) is a project designed to allow information exchange between people. The Web is based on the use of hypermedia, enabling the user to link to any other information, no matter where it is on the Internet. The people of the Web share a common technical ideology, and we are striving towards common goals. The popularity of the Internet has allowed the Web to flourish, and it is now one of the most important aspects of the Internet.</p>       
    <p>The Web has its own project space, an mail service, and member home pages. This project space is useful in maintaining Web documents, as things are always changing and it's difficult to program HTML without a browser. The Web now has many browsers: Line mode, Viola, 0.18, Arena, Mosaic and Samba, to name a few. When the Web first began, it was difficult to find out what was happening with it, and Mosaic was not a public domain browser. This has changed. Mosaic is currently available for most window systems, and the most recent versions may be obtained from NCSA via anonymous FTP.</p>   

    <h2>Future Prospects and Implications</h2>   

    <p>Backwards compatibility will always be a major issue. If future internet technologies such as distributed computing, distributed multimedia, and synchronised document editing are to embrace the web, they will each need to access and manipulate web objects such as documents and forms. They should reuse and extend existing web technology, rather than bypassing it. It is clearly stated that the future of document technology will enable people to move far beyond the paper-like resources which form the current web. This too must be done in a way which does not bypass the existing medium. Our hope is that the principle of universal access will be maintained as the web migrates to new technologies and media types.</p> 
    <p>The technologies of the web infrastructure will continue to evolve. New hardware, for example, will probably incorporate firewalls, routers and network connectivity more commonly than is the case for present PCs. The web's security and internationalism may well be threatened if future operating systems and networked file systems come to assume complex user identities and proprietary metadata.</p>
    <p>It may be interesting to compare this dynamic age of the web with a possible later stationary or even declining age, and to try to foresee the changes. Although no aspects of the future are cast in stone, this section attempts to highlight some emerging technologies and trends. Only those with a clear potential to influence the web positively or negatively are discussed. </p>
