    <h1>Design Strategies for Interface Mapping Alignment</h1>

    <p>Most importantly, in order to have good interface mapping alignment, the designer must understand the system model that they are mapping onto. If the system model is simple, then the interface mapping may be obvious and intuitive to the user. However, if the system model is complex, it may be impossible to produce perfect interface mapping. In this situation, the user will have to learn a complex mapping, and the action will result in better functionality.</p>
    <p>However, the user will risk losing flexibility as their higher-level actions become tied to the lower-level sequence. This is always a trade-off between flexibility and functionality, and the designer must decide upon the right level of interface mapping alignment.</p>   
    <p>Interface mapping would therefore be a bridge between the user's model and the system's model, and in order to achieve good interface mapping, we must understand the user's model. An example of the first type of interface mapping would be a "save" command. This can be expressed in many different ways, such as clicking a disk icon or using Ctrl+S, as long as they all result in the same action taking place.</p>
    <p>An example of the second type would be in a foreign mapping, where a similar command in the same system results in a similar action. For example, in Microsoft Windows, the user knows they can cut and paste by using Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V, while in Apple Mac, the user knows they can perform a similar function by using Command+C and Command+V. This type of interface mapping ensures the user a higher level of consonance and control with the system.</p>
    <p>Effective interface mapping alignment occurs in two ways: first, allowing the same command to be expressed through different interfaces; and second, displaying similar commands by similar interfaces. This can be elaborated by using a conceptual model of a system, which consists of a mapping between the system and the user in the form of the system model and the user model.</p>

    <h2>Understanding User Preferences</h2>   

    <p>Understanding user preferences encapsulates the requirements and wants that are being collected from various users regarding how they expect a system to work. This will represent the desired characteristics of a system. To know user preferences, there are several methods that designers can use. These include directly asking the users, conducting a survey, and studying existing similar systems that have a lot of users.</p>
    <p>Although desired preferences can vary among users, there are usually some common things that are agreed upon by users. These common preferences are the ones that designers should take seriously into consideration. But direct contact with the user is the most reliable way to know user preferences because there is a full opportunity to ask questions and have discussions to get a clear idea.</p> 
    <p>Based on the title of the section, stated that to make a website successful in achieving its objectives and purposes, the designer has to understand the user's needs and wants before developing the website. Therefore, user satisfaction is very critical to web development. In order to fulfill their expectations and satisfy the users, first and foremost, the designers need to know what users like and dislike.</p> 
    <p>Knowing user preferences will enable the designers to foresee the user's behavior and reaction when they reach the website. This is because most of the websites that achieve high user satisfaction are based on a solid understanding of user wants and needs. But novice designers cannot foresee things based on a little understanding and would use their own imagination and preferences when developing the website.</p>
    <p>This will result in a huge assumption error and difference of opinion between the designers' perspective and the actual user preferences. From these assumptions, the designers will develop the website based on their own taste without having a real idea about what users want. Steadily, this will decrease user satisfaction towards the website and end in failure. Therefore, it is very important to have a clear picture of user preferences when developing a website.</p>
   
    <h3>Providing Seamless Navigation</h3>
    <p>An alternative and more abstract view of navigation is described in terms of the aforementioned mapping as a single information preserving transformation between two sets. This is actually a very general definition that covers the action-to-state mappings and transitions between pages or views. Because the most common view of navigation is inter-page, it has received the most attention in web design and is the focus. However, navigation is often more than a sequence of in-page actions that take the user to a different view.</p>
    <p>The difficulties users may have in affecting an appropriate navigation from the interface to the underlying content and back are fundamental in web design. It is becoming appreciated that good navigation is a key to the success of a site and contributes to user satisfaction.</p>
    <p>However, the means of achieving seamless navigation are far from obvious. In order to inform this issue, it is helpful to explain navigation in terms of the tight coupling between the user's actions at the interface and the effects of those actions on the content. This is typically treated in terms of an action-to-state mapping, where action is interpreted broadly to mean any user operation, and state is any configuration of content and interface.</p>
    <p>Tasks are then seen as a sequence of actions that move the system from one state to another until the user judges that the task is completed. High usability is then achieved by getting the user to the desired content state and task completion with a minimum of time and effort.</p>
    <p>In terms of the action-to-state mapping, the quality of navigation can then be assessed by the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of the user in reaching the desired state. This view of navigation is directly translatable to the way users and designers think about it, but may not give a complete picture of what is going on.</p>
