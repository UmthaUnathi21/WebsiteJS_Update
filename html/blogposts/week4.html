    <h1>Importance of Wireframes in Web Design</h1>

    <p>Wireframes are a crucial part of the initial design phase for a screen design, i.e. the UI/UX for anything that has a screen - from mobile phones to kiosks to applications and websites. It is generally in this phase that any design flaws are found, and although any changes at this stage, in comparison to changes in the development phase, will be relatively cheap, it can highlight any flawed logic in the systematic layout of the design.</p>
    <p>This makes wireframes an important aspect of web development as it acts as a blueprint for the design and ensures it adheres to the criteria, as well as delivering an outline of development for the developer. If a suitable wireframe is produced, the developer can use it as a map for development without needing further input from the designer. This can be a massive cost and time-saving factor, as ideally, it is generally a good thing to try and keep the designer and developer separated and prioritizing their given tasks, which is something I will discuss in great detail later.</p>   

    <h2>Iterative Testing and Refinement</h2>   

    <p>Alternatively, the IxD professional can take on a more formative evaluation of their design themselves. This can be achieved through techniques such as discount usability testing or expert reviews.</p>
    <p>A usability test is a method of user interface evaluation which is quick, fast, and easy to put together. Expert reviews can be performed informally with colleagues, and by keeping the intended user in mind, it can be evaluated how clear the design is and whether the interface would make the task easier for the specific user. This can then lead to the redesign or iteration of a specific part of the design, and thus the testing and refinement cycle begins again.</p> 
    <p>Iterative testing and refinement involves the IxD professional repeatedly testing the design solutions and refining them. During this phase, the design is evaluated and alternative and divergent implementations are investigated.</p>
    <p>"What works" and "what does not work" can have the same end result. For example, if a user flow through a complex task is efficient, the user may be unable to recall the steps taken. Conversely, if the task is accomplished, some basic goals may have been missed. This mixed result is possible because there is frequently a trade-off between usability and additional factors such as features, speed, or cost. Test results provide explicit data about the degree to which a design meets specific usability objectives. This phase can be as formal as a usability test in a usability lab or as informal as asking a colleague to review it.</p>
