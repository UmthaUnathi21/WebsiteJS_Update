    <h1>Infrastructure Limitations</h1>

    <p>Developed countries may not face such extreme situations, but infrastructure problems are still a concern. For example, in Japan, where the majority of the population is packed tightly into huge cities, surrounding rural areas are often left behind when it comes to infrastructure development. So, while the general infrastructure of Japan is excellent, there are still places without internet access due to distance from the closest connection point. These areas without internet are coined as "black zones". Black zones may also be caused by telecom companies not investing in the necessary infrastructure due to a small return on investment. All of these infrastructure limitations result in a barrier to internet access.</p>       
    <p>Unfortunately, for some countries and areas, internet access is not possible due to infrastructure limitations. Infrastructure limitations can differ greatly depending on the area in question. In rural or underdeveloped areas, infrastructure limitations can simply mean that there are no means of internet access.</p>
    <p>Some areas may have the infrastructure required for internet access, but due to political/economic troubles or conflict, the infrastructure is severely damaged or cannot be maintained. These situations are common in areas affected by war or so-called "failed states". The saying "failed state" refers to a country that cannot or does not provide the most basic needs for its citizens. This includes but is not limited to protection, food, clean water, and shelter. These countries or areas are often at rock bottom in terms of infrastructure, and rebuilding to a point where internet access is possible can take years.</p>
    <p>The infrastructure of a nation can greatly affect the success of internet access. Internet is a connection of computers which allows information exchange. This exchange of information can occur in many different ways such as email, chat, video conferencing, e-commerce, and so on. Internet access itself is an inexpensive and effective way to exchange information nationwide, making it an extremely useful tool. It has become so useful and popular that the United Nations has deemed internet access a human right.</p>

    <h2>Policy Implications and Recommendations</h2>   

    <p>An important factor in this policy change is to attempt to redefine internet access as a utility. This would imply that internet access is an essential public service which can improve the lives of citizens and assist in the development of progressive societies. This change has already been noted in the case of remote and rural areas in the USA where broadband funding has occurred in areas which have little to no access to the internet. The employment of this policy would be of great benefit to developing nations in their quest to bridge the digital divide.</p> 
    <p>As a fundamental right, internet access must be obtainable by all people and should not be segregated by social groups. By defining the internet as a necessary public service, it can be better provided to those in the Global South. A worthy recommendation for this policy change would be to make this a new millennium development goal. Should global poverty continue to decrease and internet access progresses at its current rate, this can be a realistic goal which can lead to improvements in global health and living conditions.</p>
    <p>These developments have positive implications on government policy changes regarding internet access and in relation to its classification as a fundamental right. The European Union is currently debating an electronic communications code which sets out to incentivize investment in high-speed internet. It is suggested that there will be added regulation to internet service providers to provide more effective services to consumers. Although the pretext of this code is to supposedly benefit the internal market, it could prove beneficial to providing a universal standard of internet access throughout the EU. Individual nations also have an increased interest in the digital economy.</p>
    <p>Investment in technological infrastructure can not only foster economic growth and competitiveness but also, as mentioned previously, improve access to the internet. Although in some cases government investment may not be feasible due to financial constraints, it must be understood that internet access is a right which transcends all forms of marginalized social groups. Investment in this area could prove beneficial in reducing existing social disparities. In particularly severe cases, aid may be required from supranational organizations such as the UN or WHO.</p>
