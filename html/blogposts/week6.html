    <h1>Importance of UX and UI Principles</h1>

    <p>User experience (UX) and user interface (UI) are two of the most important factors in creating a website. These two concepts can make or break a successful site. The user's interaction with the website as a whole is what makes up the UX because it is the experience they are obtaining. This can be as simple as navigating the site to everything involved with servicing and interacting with the site.</p>       
    <p>The UI is anything that helps the user interact with your product. This includes everything from screens, pages, and visual elements like a page's design. When you put both of these concepts together from a consumer standpoint, it makes up the value of the website. A consumer will gauge how much they value the site overall and if it's worth revisiting. This directly ties into a consumer purchasing a product on the site or retrieving information. All of this being said, there are several important principles that should be implemented during the process of creating a webpage using UX and UI.</p>
    <p>Two of the most important things that factor into the effectiveness of a site are the performance of the site and its aesthetics. High-performing sites that are both fast and reliable are going to attract more viewers. This is a simple concept that definitely holds true in today's information age. According to Microsoft, our average attention span is now 8 seconds long. This is a 33% decrease from the year 2000.</p>
    <p>With that being said, if a site's performance is poor, such as slow loading times, the number of users visiting the site is going to dramatically decrease. The likelihood of those users returning to the site also goes down. This ties back into the value of the website, and it's something you want to avoid. Aesthetics, as stated, can be summed up with the overall look of a website, and it's very important. This happens to be the most noticeable factor for a user when judging the value of a site. Based on the appearance of the website, it is also going to be a deciding factor as to whether or not a visitor will return to the site in the future.</p>
   

    <h2>Examining successful wedsites</h2>   

    <p>Apple.com - The navigation in Apple's website is simple and consistent which adds to the intuitive UI and in turn provides a great user experience. The site consists of global navigation that only uses text, drop down menus, and a site search. All of these features can be found on any page of the site and in the same layout.</p>
    <p>The global navigation is the most important since it gets the user to the product that they are looking for, and it consists of a list of Apple's products. This allows users to navigate to their intended location without getting lost using a small amount of mouse clicks. The drop down menus are used to reach specific models and the site search is for someone who is not exactly sure what they are wanting. Because all of these features are consistent, it is easy for a user to quickly get to their desired destination.</p> 
    <p>When looking at the first thing that comes to mind is the user interface and experience since the design itself is very minimal. The iOS-like design, consisting of large images and high readability text, is consistent throughout the website, even with different products and accessed through different devices. This is vital since Macs, iPads, iPhones and iPods are used to access the site. Users do not want to search for what they are looking for because the layout is different, and users of iPhone and iPad do not want to view a site with flash when it does not work on their devices.</p>

    <p>Rolls-roycemotors.com - The website rolls-roycemotors.com is, as its name suggests, the official website for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. This website is truly one of a kind. It won't be an exaggeration to say that rolls-roycemotors.com is a work of art. The elegance and sophistication of this website is on a whole new level. This is a website that confidently represents the Rolls Royce brand and none other. The website manages to create a visual imagery of unparalleled luxury. This is consistent with the Rolls Royce brand image. This is done via high quality photographs, smooth flash animations, and well-crafted visuals.</p>
    <p>All these aspects of the website scream out luxury. This is not an easy feat to achieve even amongst luxury brand websites, as it is all too common for "luxury" brand websites to simply translate to white backgrounds and minimalist designs. But not in the case of Rolls Royce. In fact, the brand is not afraid to show that it is head and shoulders above the rest. An interesting point to note is that the website does not contain embedded video content. This may seem strange as it's now basically the industry standard to have video content on websites, but this is actually a good move by Rolls Royce, as video content does not equate to luxury and may, in fact, detract from the sophisticated image that Rolls Royce is trying to portray.</p>
    
    <p>Patek.com - Patek.com does not shy away from persuading the consumer to make a purchase. There are call-to-actions at almost every corner on the site. Be it taking the visitor into reading more on the top banner about the latest collection or on the lower left prompting them to view a video that conveys Patek Philippe's history. The most common way of reaching out would have to be through the ads that slide up from the bottom right corner.</p> 
    <p>While some people may find this a nuisance feature, the demographics for Patek.com visitors would appreciate the non-intrusiveness of these ads, not to mention the high-quality animation and clear message of what is being presented. For the younger patrons who are new to Patek Philippe, they may find an ad that takes them to the What's New page before it changes locations to a Patek enthusiast who is simply looking for the latest books on the brand. Ads are a more direct way of leading the consumer to what they are interested in. Patek.com ads do this accurately.</p> 
    <p>Patek.com has been created with its customer demographic in mind. With its luxury aura, the website itself is aimed to give the consumer an experience parallel to what they would get when purchasing a Patek Philippe calibre. The user-focused content organization on Patek.com is outstanding; in one click, the consumer is taken into a world dedicated to the appreciation of time itself.</p>
    <p>The website avoids covering the common aspects of most watch retail sites. There is pride in the fact that Patek Philippe timepieces are incomparable, and this is what the site is dedicated to proving. With the website being a reflection of the actual product, the luxury essence is never lost. The smooth transition of pages and overall elegance can be seen as the virtual form of wearing a Patek Philippe.</p>
