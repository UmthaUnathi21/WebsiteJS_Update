        Wireframes are a crucial part of the initial design phase for a screen design.

    <p>
        User experience (UX) and user interface (UI) are two of the most important factors in creating a website.</p> 
    <p>  These two concepts can make or break a successful site.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 7: <a href="../html/blogposts/week7.html">The Impact of Internet Access on Education</a></h2>
    <p>
        The internet enhances flexibility in learning, making it more attractive and interactive.</p>
    <p>It creates a student-centered private environment which enables learners to feel more free.

    <p>
        Turning to specific human rights, there are a multitude of rights that internet access aids in realizing.</p>
    <p>

    <h2>Week 10: <a href="../html/blogposts/week10.html">Reflection on Digital inequalities and why they matter</a></h2>
    <p>
        The most commonly discussed type of digital inequality is the inequality of access to information technology.</p> 
    <p>   Often, people who are of a lower socioeconomic status have less access to new forms of information technology 
        and are therefore put at a disadvantage compared to their higher-income counterparts.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 11: <a href="../html/blogposts/week11.html">Analysis on Algorithmic Injustices: Towards a Relational Ethics</a></h2>
    <p>
        At first glance, this appears to be a fantastic solution to a deeply embedded and complex problem.</p> 
    <p>    
        However, the mechanism by which ethics are to be encoded and represented in technology is seldom questioned.
